### Summary
This project has been created with the aim to predict chronic kidney diseases using XGBOOST model.

The data was taken over a 2-month period in India with 25 features ( eg, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, etc). The target is the 'classification', which is either 'ckd' or 'notckd' - ckd=chronic kidney disease. Use machine learning techniques to predict if a patient is suffering from a chronic kidney disease or not.
